			<li>All robots except for EXCEL-GAN Super Mode and ELL-GEL-ION Awakening are legal to use! This includes AEGIS 2 robots and promos!</li>
			<li>The tournament uses a double-elimination bracket. Matches will be best 2-of-3.</li>
			<li>Scrap combining will not be used.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are a few rule changes from AEGIS 1 that will be accounted for this tournament:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class=strong>Turn 1 Armistice.</span> A player cannot be attacked until that player has taken a turn. This means that the first player cannot attack the second player, but the second player <em>can</em> attack the first!</li>
			<li><span class=strong>Board Variations!</span> Both the standard 2-Player AEGIS board and the AEGIS2 "Skinny Board" are going to be used. The first round of each best 2-of-3 match will have a randomly chosen board, and after round 1, the loser will choose the board. <em>Players can sideboard before the first game after seeing which board they will be playing on!</em></li>
			<li><span class=strong>Turn Timer!</span> This tournament, there is a 5-minute turn timer to keep the game moving fast.</li>
