		<h1>AEGIS League</h1>
		<p>Welcome to AEGIS Organized Play!</p>
		<p>Whenever you play a game in real life or in Tabletop Simulator, you can simply report your opponent and the scores, and they will be recorded on the AEGIS League Leaderboard!</p>

		<h1>AEGIS League Season 4 (April - TBD 2021)</h1>
		<p>Season 4 ends TBD. Anyone who participates will get a special promo card mailed to them at the end of the season. In addition, a tournament with cash prizes will follow the end of the League season!</p>
		<p>*** This season, players will have the opportunity to play with new AEGIS cards from the game's upcoming expansion! Playing with those and reporting feedback will get you listed in the next rulebook.</p>
		
		<! -- I'm lazy, ok? I can use this for next time instead of retyping it.

		<h3>Tournament Rules</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bring a team of five robots, a sideboard of 2 robots (which can be swapped out between games), and a combine pool of up to 10 combine robots!</li>
			<li>All robots except for EXCEL-GAN Super Mode and ELL-GEL-ION Awakening are legal to use! This includes AEGIS 2 robots and promos!</li>
			<li>The tournament uses a double-elimination bracket. Matches will be best 2-of-3.</li>
			<li>Scrap combining will not be used.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There are a few rule changes from AEGIS 1 that will be accounted for this tournament:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class=strong>Turn 1 Armistice.</span> A player cannot be attacked until that player has taken a turn. This means that the first player cannot attack the second player, but the second player <em>can</em> attack the first!</li>
			<li><span class=strong>Board Variations!</span> Both the standard 2-Player AEGIS board and the AEGIS2 "Skinny Board" are going to be used. The first round of each best 2-of-3 match will have a randomly chosen board, and after round 1, the loser will choose the board. <em>Players can sideboard before the first game after seeing which board they will be playing on!</em></li>
			<li><span class=strong>Turn Timer!</span> This tournament, there is a 5-minute turn timer to keep the game moving fast.</li>
		</ul> -->
