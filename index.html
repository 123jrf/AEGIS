		<h1>AEGIS League</h1>
		<p>Welcome to AEGIS Organized Play!</p>
		
		<h1>AEGIS: Second Ignition Launch Tournament (May - June 2025)</h1>
		<p><a href="Tournament Game report form:"<b>Tournament Game report form</b></a></p>

		<h2>Tournament Teams</h2>
		<p><b>Banned Robots:</b> EXCEL-GAN Super Mode</p>
		<p><b>Basic Robots:</b> 5, plus up to 2 sideboards.</p>
		<p><b>Combines:</b> Up to 7.</p>


		<h2>Tournament Rules</h2>
		<p><b>Best-of-3 Matches:</b> Matches will be best-of-3.</p>
		<p><b>Board Variations:</b> The first game of the match will always be played on the Arena Board (the one without the river). For the second and third game, the player who lost the previous game can choose either the Arena Board or the River Board.</p>
		<p><b>Sideboards:</b> You must always use your first five basic robots for the first game of the match. In between games, both players can swap out their basic robots for those from their sideboard as they see fit.</p>
		<p><b>Turn Timer:</b> In order to keep things moving along, there is a 7-minute turn timer!</p>
		<p><b>Turn 1 Armistice:</b> A player's robots cannot be damaged until that player has had a turn. In effect, Player 1 cannot damage Player 2 on the first turn of the game. (But Player 2 <i>can</i> damage Player 1's bots on their first turn since Player 1 has already had a turn!)</p>
